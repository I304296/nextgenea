# Security
There will be one IAS/IPS tenant utilized for our team and app:

[IAS/IPS Tenant]
(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bf5c649-ad18-4bba-9d45-fe694d3ba9ce)

We will only need to leverage one tenant for production/test since it's a centalized security and user provisioning tool. Admins can provision users to Dev/QA/Prod environments of various applications. Having a test and production IAS tenant doubles the work and will cause confusion.

Current IAS/IPS admins:
1. Mac Moylan - mac.moylan@sap.com
2. Shibaji Chandra - shibaji.chandra@sap.com

If would like to be an admin please reach out to Mac or Shibaji.
