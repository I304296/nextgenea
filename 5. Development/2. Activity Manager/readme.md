Welcome to the Engagement Planner/NextGen EA Platform



The ‘Engagement Planner/NexGen EA Platform’ offers a simplified and logical approach to guidance EA’s to engage on Value Added Activities while working with assigned customers in the Regions. 

The ‘Engagement Planner’ has a modularization approach to provide Activity Sections based on the EA activity needs to support customers Business Transformation requirements. 

Inside of the Activity Sections, there are Mandatory Activities that the EA must engage to ensure minimum quality deliverables. Other Activities will be optional to add additional value to the Business Transformation.
